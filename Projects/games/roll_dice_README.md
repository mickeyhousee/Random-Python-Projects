# role_dice.py

The code you have provided is a simple dice rolling game. It uses the `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 6, which represents the number of dots on a die. The code then prints the number of dots and draws the corresponding die image.

Here are the steps involved in the code:

1. The `clear_console()` function clears the console screen.
2. The `roll_dice()` function generates a random number between 1 and 6 and prints it to the console.
3. The `one()`, `two()`, `three()`, `four()`, `five()`, and `six()` functions draw the corresponding die images.
4. The `main()` function gets the user input and calls the appropriate function.
