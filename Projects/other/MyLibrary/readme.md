 **MyLibrary: A Python Library for Mathematical Operations**

**Introduction**

The `MyLibrary` is a Python library that provides a collection of functions for performing mathematical operations. This library is designed to make it easy for developers to perform common mathematical tasks in their Python programs.

**Installation**

To install the `MyLibrary`, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install MyLibrary
```

**Usage**

The `MyLibrary` can be used by importing it into your Python program. Once imported, you can access the library's functions by using the `MyLibrary.` prefix.

For example, to add two numbers together, you can use the `somar()` function as follows:

```python
from MyLibrary.operacoes import somar

resultado = somar(5, 3)
print("A soma é:", resultado)
```

This code will print the following output:

```
A soma é: 8
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the code above:

1. We first import the `somar()` function from the `MyLibrary.operacoes` module.
2. We then call the `somar()` function with two arguments, 5 and 3.
3. The `somar()` function adds the two arguments together and returns the result.
4. We then store the result in the variable `resultado`.
5. Finally, we print the value of the `resultado` variable to the console.

**Conclusion**

The `MyLibrary` is a powerful and easy-to-use library for performing mathematical operations in Python. This library can be used by developers of all levels to improve the efficiency and accuracy of their Python programs.
